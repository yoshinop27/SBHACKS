This guide will walk you through how to transcribe pre-recorded audio with the Deepgram API. We provide two scenarios to try: transcribe a remote file and transcribe a local file.

<Info>
  Before you start, you'll need to follow the steps in the [Make Your First API Request](/guides/fundamentals/make-your-first-api-request) guide to obtain a Deepgram API key, and configure your environment if you are choosing to use a Deepgram SDK.
</Info>

## CURL

Next, try it with CURL. Add your own API key where it says `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` and then run the following examples in a terminal or your favorite API client.

If you run the "Local file CURL Example," be sure to change `@youraudio.wav` to the path/filename of an audio file on your computer. (Read more about supported audio formats [here](/docs/supported-audio-formats)).

### Remote File CURL Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"url":"https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav"}' \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-3&smart_format=true'
  ```
</CodeGroup>
### Local File CURL Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
    --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-3&smart_format=true'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  The above example includes the parameter `model=nova-3`, which tells the API to use Deepgram's most latest model. Removing this parameter will result in the API using the default model, which is currently `model=base`.

  It also includes Deepgram's [Smart Formatting](/docs/smart-format) feature, `smart_format=true`. This will format currency amounts, phone numbers, email addresses, and more for enhanced transcript readability.
</Info>

## SDKs

To transcribe pre-recorded audio using one of Deepgram's SDKs, follow these steps.

### Install the SDK

Open your terminal, navigate to the location on your drive where you want to create your project, and install the Deepgram SDK.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell JavaScript
  # Install the Deepgram JS SDK
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk

  npm install @deepgram/sdk
  ```

  ```shell Python
  # Install the Deepgram Python SDK
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk

  pip install deepgram-sdk
  ```

  ```shell C#
  # Install the Deepgram .NET SDK
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-dotnet-sdk

  dotnet add package Deepgram
  ```

  ```shell Go
  # Install the Deepgram Go SDK
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk

  go get github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Add Dependencies

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell JavaScript
  # Install dotenv to protect your api key

  npm install dotenv
  ```

  ```shell Python
  # Install python-dotenv to protect your API key

  pip install python-dotenv
  ```

  ```shell C#
  // In your .csproj file, add the Package Reference:

  <ItemGroup>
      <PackageReference Include="Deepgram" Version="4.4.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
  ```

  ```shell Go
  # Importing the Deepgram Go SDK should pull in all dependencies required
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Transcribe a Remote File

This example shows how to analyze a **remote audio file** (a URL that hosts your audio file) using Deepgram's SDKs. In your terminal, create a new file in your project's location, and populate it with the code.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  // index.js (node example)

  const { createClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");
  require("dotenv").config();

  const transcribeUrl = async () => {
    // STEP 1: Create a Deepgram client using the API key
    const deepgram = createClient(process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);

    // STEP 2: Call the transcribeUrl method with the audio payload and options
    const { result, error } = await deepgram.listen.prerecorded.transcribeUrl(
      {
        url: "https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav",
      },
      // STEP 3: Configure Deepgram options for audio analysis
      {
        model: "nova-3",
        smart_format: true,
      }
    );

    if (error) throw error;
    // STEP 4: Print the results
    if (!error) console.dir(result, { depth: null });
  };

  transcribeUrl();
  ```

  ```python Python
  # For help migrating to the new Python SDK, check out our migration guide:
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/docs/Migrating-v3-to-v5.md

  # main.py (python example)

  import os
  import logging

  from deepgram import (
      DeepgramClient,
  )

  def main():
      try:
          # STEP 1 Create a Deepgram client using the DEEPGRAM_API_KEY from your environment variables
          deepgram: DeepgramClient = DeepgramClient()

          # STEP 2 Call the transcribe_url method with the audio URL and options
          response = deepgram.listen.v1.media.transcribe_url(
              url="https://dpgr.am/bueller.wav",
              model="nova-3",
              smart_format=True,
          )
          print(f"response: {response}\n\n")

      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Exception: {e}")

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```

  ```csharp C#
  // Program.cs (.NET example)

  using Deepgram.Models.Listen.v1.REST;

  namespace PreRecorded
  {
      class Program
      {
          static async Task Main(string[] args)
          {
              // Initialize Library with default logging
              // Normal logging is "Info" level
              Library.Initialize();

              // create a ListenRESTClient directly (without using the factory method) with a API Key
              // set using the "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" environment variable
              var deepgramClient = new ListenRESTClient();

              var response = await deepgramClient.TranscribeUrl(
                  new UrlSource("https://dpgr.am/bueller.wav"),
                  new PreRecordedSchema()
                  {
                      Model = "nova-3",
                  });

              Console.WriteLine(response);
              Console.ReadKey();

              // Teardown Library
              Library.Terminate();
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  ```go Go
  // main.go (Go example)

  package main

  import (
  	"context"
  	"encoding/json"
  	"fmt"
  	"os"

  	prettyjson "github.com/hokaccha/go-prettyjson"

  	prerecorded "github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/pkg/api/prerecorded/v1"
  	interfaces "github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/pkg/client/interfaces"

  		os.Exit(1)
  	}
  	fmt.Printf("\n\nResult:\n%s\n\n", prettyJson)
  }
  ```

### Transcribe a Local File

This example shows how to analyze a **local audio file** (an audio file on your computer) using Deepgram's SDKs. In your terminal, create a new file in your project's location, and populate it with the code. (Be sure to replace the audio filename with a path/filename of an audio file on your computer.)

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  // index.js (node example)

  const { createClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");
  const fs = require("fs");

  const transcribeFile = async () => {
    // STEP 1: Create a Deepgram client using the API key
    const deepgram = createClient(process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);

    // STEP 2: Call the transcribeFile method with the audio payload and options
    const { result, error } = await deepgram.listen.prerecorded.transcribeFile(
      // path to the audio file
      fs.readFileSync("spacewalk.mp3"),
      // STEP 3: Configure Deepgram options for audio analysis
      {
        model: "nova-3",
        smart_format: true,
      }
    );

    if (error) throw error;
    // STEP 4: Print the results
    if (!error) console.dir(result, { depth: null });
  };

  transcribeFile();
  ```

  ```python Python
  # For help migrating to the new Python SDK, check out our migration guide:
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/docs/Migrating-v3-to-v5.md

  # main.py (python example)

  def main():
      try:
          # STEP 1 Create a Deepgram client using the API key
          deepgram = DeepgramClient()

          # STEP 2: Call the transcribe_file method with the audio file and options
          with open(AUDIO_FILE, "rb") as audio_file:
              response = deepgram.listen.v1.media.transcribe_file(
                  request=audio_file.read(),
                  model="nova-3",
                  smart_format=True,
              )

          # STEP 3: Print the response
          print(response.to_json(indent=4))

              // Normal logging is "Info" level
              Library.Initialize();

              // use the client factory with a API Key set with the "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" environment variable
              var deepgramClient = ClientFactory.CreateListenRESTClient();

              // check to see if the file exists
              if (!File.Exists(@"Bueller-Life-moves-pretty-fast.wav"))

                  new PreRecordedSchema()
                  {
                      Model = "nova-3",
                  });

              Console.WriteLine($"\n\n{response}\n\n");
              Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit...");
              Console.ReadKey();

## Non-SDK Code Examples

If you would like to try out making a Deepgram speech-to-text request in a specific language (but not using Deepgram's SDKs), we offer a library of code-samples in this [Github repo](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/code-samples). However, we recommend first trying out our SDKs.

## Results

In order to see the results from Deepgram, you must run the application. Run your application from the terminal. Your transcripts will appear in your shell.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell JavaScript
  # Run your application using the file you created in the previous step
  # Example: node index.js

  node YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.js
  ```

  ```shell Python
  # Run your application using the file you created in the previous step
  # Example: python main.py

  python YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.py
  ```

  ```shell C#
  # Run your application using the file you created in the previous step
  # Example: dotnet run Program.cs

  dotnet run YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.cs
  ```

  ```shell Go
  # Run your application using the file you created in the previous step
  # Example: go run main.go

  go run YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.go
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Deepgram does not store transcripts, so the Deepgram API response is the only opportunity to retrieve the transcript. Make sure to save output or [return transcriptions to a callback URL for custom processing](/docs/callback/).
</Warning>

### Analyze the Response

When the file is finished processing (often after only a few seconds), you’ll receive a JSON response:

In this default response, we see:

* `transcript`: the transcript for the audio segment being processed.

* `confidence`: a floating point value between 0 and 1 that indicates overall transcript reliability. Larger values indicate higher confidence.

* `words`: an object containing each `word` in the transcript, along with its `start` time and `end` time (in seconds) from the beginning of the audio stream, and a `confidence` value.

  Because we passed the `smart_format: true` option to the `transcription.prerecorded` method, each word object also includes its `punctuated_word` value, which contains the transformed word after punctuation and capitalization are applied.

<Info>
  The `transaction_key` in the `metadata` field can be ignored. The result will always be `"transaction_key": "deprecated"`.

## Limits

There are a few limits to be aware of when making a pre-recorded speech-to-text request.

### File Size

* The maximum file size is limited to 2 GB.
* For large video files, extract the audio stream and upload only the audio to Deepgram. This reduces the file size significantly.

### Rate Limits

**Nova, Base, and Enhanced Models:**

* Maximum of 100 concurrent requests per project.
* For information on Deepgram's Concurrency Rate Limits, refer to our [API Rate Limits Documentation](/reference/api-rate-limits).

**Whisper Model:**

* Paid plan: 15 concurrent requests.
* Pay-as-you-go plan: 5 concurrent requests.

Exceeding these limits will result in a 429: Too Many Requests error.

### Maximum Processing Time

**Fast Transcription Models (Nova, Base, and Enhanced)**

* These models offer extremely fast transcription.
* Maximum processing time: 10 minutes.

**Slower Transcription Model (Whisper)**

* Whisper transcribes more slowly compared to other models.
* Maximum processing time: 20 minutes.

**Timeout Policy**

* If a request exceeds the maximum processing time, it will be canceled.
* In such cases, a 504: Gateway Timeout error will be returned.
